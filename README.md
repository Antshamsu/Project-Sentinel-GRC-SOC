Project Sentinel: The Compliance-to-Detection Lifecycle 🛡️

Executive Summary:

As a professional with a **Master’s in Cybersecurity, a BBA, and CISA/Security+ certifications**, I developed this project to demonstrate the integration of **Governance (GRC)**, **Monitoring (SOC)**, and **Risk Analysis**. 

This project simulates a real-world enterprise scenario: Defining a security standard, detecting violations, and analyzing the business risk.
